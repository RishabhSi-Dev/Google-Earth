##Google Earth Engine Imports
The following variables are defined using the **Google Earth Engine "Imports" panel**
(Since I am unable to paste the imports panel, I added a screenshot of it instead)

They include:
- AOI (polygon)
- Image collection reference
- Visualization parameters

> These variables are created via the Earth Engine Code Editor UI and are referenced directly in the script.

I will further add images of maps with different layers added.
